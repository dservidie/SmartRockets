# SmartRockets
Playing with Daniel Shiffman's code from his book: https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/

## Description
Rockets use a series of commands stored in its DNA array. The most successful rockets will be able to pass its genes to the next generation of rockets. A mutation in some genes, gives opportunities to improve performance, and in that case, pass those genes.

You can watch this code in action and play with it in this codepen project:

## Rocket controls
Rockets dna includes instructions of main thrust power, and steering. Each gene of the rocket will contain those instructions. Each gene will be executed during a certain amount of frames.

If you want to test manually the rockets control parameters to understand the physics you can do it in this codepen:
